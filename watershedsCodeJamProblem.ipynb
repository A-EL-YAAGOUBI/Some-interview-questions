    "# Problem :\n",
    "\n",
    "Geologists sometimes divide an area of land into different regions based on where rainfall flows down to. These regions are called drainage basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an elevation map (a 2-dimensional array of altitudes), label the map such that locations in the same drainage basin have the same label, subject to the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From each cell, water flows down to at most one of its 4 neighboring cells.\n",
    "- For each cell, if none of its 4 neighboring cells has a lower altitude than the current cell's, then the water does not flow, and the current cell is called a sink.\n",
    "- Otherwise, water flows from the current cell to the neighbor with the lowest altitude.\n",
    "- In case of a tie, water will choose the first direction with the lowest altitude from this list: North, West, East, South.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every cell that drains directly or indirectly to the same sink is part of the same drainage basin. Each basin is labeled by a unique lower-case letter, in such a way that, when the rows of the map are concatenated from top to bottom, the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. (In particular, the basin of the most North-Western cell is always labeled 'a'.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the input file will contain the number of maps, T. T maps will follow, each starting with two integers on a line -- H and W -- the height and width of the map, in cells. The next H lines will each contain a row of the map, from north to south, each containing W integers, from west to east, specifying the altitudes of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, output 1+H lines. The first line must be of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "Case #X:\n",
    "where X is the test case number, starting from 1. The next H lines must list the basin labels for each of the cells, in the same order as they appear in the input."
